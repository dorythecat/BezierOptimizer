# BezierOptimizer

# Why?
This program is mainly made both as a personal challenge and as a way to precalculate the equations needed for a Bézier
curve of n order. This is so that I do not have to calculate them every time I need them, or have to fight with the
numbers to make it into a simpler and more efficient operation.
