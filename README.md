# BezierOptimizer
> A little python program to optimize Bézier Curves (especially when they are hardcoded), so that the program requires
> the actual program requires the minimum number of calculations.

# Why?
This program is mainly made both as a personal challenge and as a way to precalculate the equations needed for a Bézier
curve of n order. This is so that I do not have to calculate them every time I need them, or have to fight with the
numbers to make it into a simpler and more efficient operation. I even included both Python and Matlab output modes
so that you can more easily get them actually imported wherever you need them, without too much hassle. It's also
pretty easy (I think) to modify, to add new output modes tbh.

# Usage
This program is designed to be used as a command line tool. To use it follow the instructions you will get when you
run the program with no arguments, or the `-h` or `--help` flags. Aka, to see hwo to use the program, just run
`python main.py`, `python main.py -h` or `python main.py --help`. It's that easy. :D
